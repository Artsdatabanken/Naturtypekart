Prerequisites for spatial types with Microsoft SQL Server.  SQL Server spatial support depends on the low-level, SQL Server-specific types SqlGeography and SqlGeometry. 

The SQL Server System CLR Types package contains the components implementing the geometry, geography, and hierarchy id types in SQL Server. This component can be installed separately from the server to allow client applications to use these types outside of the server.
